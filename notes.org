* Learn Python the Hard Way Notes
** Observations
 * optional parens invoking functions (at least in some contexts)
 * variadic print function
 * Standard arithmetic operator precedence
 * snake_case var names
 * dynamic var types
 * ints cast to floats in mixed arithmetic
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
   type(1 * 1.0)
   <type 'float'>
   #+END_SRC
 * NameError format: =NameError: name 'average_passengers_per_car' is not defined=
 * %r formatter is a bit like ruby inspect -- gives programmer style format
 * can do destructuring assignment (=a,b = [1,2]=), but seems to only work with equal number of values
 * Current epoch seconds:
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
   from time import time
   int(time())
   #+END_SRC


** Questions
 * Encoding String: =# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-= -- when is this necessary?
 * Double-quoted vs single quoted strings -- matter?
