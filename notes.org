* Learn Python the Hard Way Notes
** Observations
 * optional parens invoking functions (at least in some contexts)
 * variadic print function
 * Standard arithmetic operator precedence
 * snake_case var names
 * dynamic var types
 * ints cast to floats in mixed arithmetic
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
   type(1 * 1.0)
   <type 'float'>
   #+END_SRC
 * NameError format: =NameError: name 'average_passengers_per_car' is not defined=
 * %r formatter is a bit like ruby inspect -- gives programmer style format
 * can do destructuring assignment (=a,b = [1,2]=), but seems to only work with equal number of values
 * Current epoch seconds:
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
   from time import time
   int(time())
   #+END_SRC
 * *EXPLICIT RETURNS*
 * Importing:
    * each file is treated as a module
    * import the module by the filename (eg file =time.py= then =import time=)
    * module import names module as itself; lets us refer to nested identifiers with dot notation
    * also can import explicit names (functions) from a module =import pizza from italian_food= would find
      =def pizza...= in file =italian_food.py=


** Questions
 * Encoding String: =# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-= -- when is this necessary?
 * Double-quoted vs single quoted strings -- matter?
